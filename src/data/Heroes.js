Cuando era bebé, sus padres, el científico Jor-El, y su esposa Lara Lor-Van, lo enviaron a la Tierra en una pequeña nave espacial momentos antes de que Krypton fuera destruido en un cataclismo natural. Su nave aterrizó en el campo estadounidense, cerca de la ciudad ficticia de Smallville. Fue encontrado y adoptado por los agricultores Jonathan y Martha Kent, quienes lo llamaron Clark Kent. Clark desarrolló varias habilidades sobrehumanas, como una fuerza increíble y una piel impermeable. Sus padres adoptivos le aconsejaron que usara sus habilidades en beneficio de la humanidad y decidió luchar contra el crimen como un justiciero. Para proteger su privacidad, se pone un traje colorido y usa el alias "Superman" cuando lucha contra el crimen. Aunque denominado, algunas veces, de manera poco halagadora, como «el gran Boy Scout azul» por otros superhéroes, Superman también es conocido como «El Hombre de Acero», «El Hombre del Mañana» y «El Último Hijo de Krypton» por el público general de los cómics. Bajo la identidad de Clark Kent, Superman vive en medio de los humanos como un «tímido reportero» del diario Daily Planet de Metrópolis. Ahí trabaja junto a la reportera Lois Lane, con la cual ha sido vinculado románticamente. Junto con el fotógrafo Jimmy Olsen y el editor en jefe Perry White. Superman tiene una extensa galería de villanos con su archienemigo el supervillano Lex Luthor.'

His real name is Oliver Jonas Queen, a wealthy businessman and owner of Queen Industries who is also a well-known celebrity in Star City. He uses this position to hide the fact that he is the Arrow.Sometimes shown dressed like the character Robin Hood, Green Arrow is an archer who uses his skills to fight crime in his home cities of Star City and Seattle, as well as alongside his fellow superheroes as a member of the Justice League. Though much less frequently used in modern stories, he also deploys a range of trick arrows (in contemporary times, they are referred as "specialty arrows") with various special functions, such as glue, explosive-tipped, grappling hook, flash grenade, tear gas and even kryptonite arrows for use in a range of special situations. At the time of his debut, Green Arrow functioned in many ways as an archery-themed analogue of the very popular Batman character, but writers at DC subsequently developed him into a voice of left-wing politics very much distinct in character from Batman.'
